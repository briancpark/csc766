# Project 1 Phase I: Value Numbering
Brian Park

Here lies the README.md for the project. Feel free to view the Markdown file in a text editor or browser to properly
render the formatting. Otherwise, viewing the raw text should suffice.

To compile and run the code, it should be the commands below. There was nothing changed compared to the original starter
code.
```sh
make compile
make build
make run
```

The starter code in this repository will look different as it has been linted and reformatted.

To show the difference, here is the git diff



Below are the versions used. (on Mac)
java version "19" 2022-09-20
javac 19

### Instructions

You are provided with a template for the project. You can reuse the Makefile and the directory organization. Just add
your own files and make small changes to the Makefile. Type make, you'll complete build, compile and run in a batch way.
Check it out here and use it as a start point of your whole project. Read the README.txt in the package first! Machines
used for testing: the Linux systems in the NCSU VCL (use the "CSC 766 Code Optimization" image, which will be used in
our grading).

You must include a Readme file in which you should mention your name and the phase number first. Extra info should be
presented are
* file and directory descriptions
* building and running guide
* program descriptions, on structure and function
* descriptions of your optimizations
* bug reports
